Heavily recommend using a module for new sheets (ex. Free Form Sheets). <BR>The stats/saves that've been renamed for macro purposes are as follows: 
Mind=Intellect <BR>
Heart=Strength <BR>
Strength=Combat <BR>
Reality=Sanity <BR>

Macros for rolling spellcasting, curses, panic, stat generation, & wounds.
Spellcasting is the only complicated one, so the miscast always rolls & you'll have to manually add the additional stress on a failed check.
I might learn enough to fix spellcasting macro but maybe not.
Tables included are: Imago reactions, NPC reactions, curses, death, miscasts, panic, spores, & wounds.
I'll probably add the WDYF table soon-ish.
